# giv-da-proto-ram-nex-tim
This is a batch (*.bat) based virus that eats your ram, kinda like www.YouAreAnIdiot.org but *.bat. On this project I will also find out how to turn it into a *.exe.
All files here are required, so download via the "Go to code"/"Releases" or whatever & hit "download as zip" and extract it.
# The obvious, do's & don't's
Again, do. Not. Steal. My. Work. And. Say. You. Made. It. I'm fine if it credits me or this github, but please, don't steal my work.
# Virus Notes
This will not harm your machine **that bad**. It is made only to use up your ram and cause errors due to lack of ram. I recommand using a Virtual Machine.
DO NOT, AT ALL, PUT THIS IN "shell:startup", IT WILL RUN EVERYTIME YOU SIGN IN, PLEASE, DO NOT PUT IT IN THE STARTUP FOLDER.
To run the virus, open "giv da proto ram nex tim.bat", not "virus.bat" or "error.bat".
I don't know if it works on older versions of Windows, all I know is that it has to support *.txt, *.bat & *.vbs.
